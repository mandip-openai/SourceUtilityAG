Medium (3-5): Reflects partial relevance, with some alignment to the query but lacking depth or focus. High (6-7): Signifies strong relevance and clear alignment with the query intent, providing comprehensive and precise information.

        "  * Examples:\n",
        "    * High context alignment: For the query *\"weather in New York City\"* on a mobile device, a result displaying today’s local weather with a mobile-friendly interface.\n",
        "    * Low context alignment: A result showing a weather forecast for a different city or outdated information.\n",

It’s had many wonderful improvements over the years. However, since the update giving masculine/feminine translations for gendered languages, copy & paste has been ruined for me.\\n> Previously, the app would often predict needed gendered letters/words based on other words being translated, and a simple copy & paste almost always the immediately available next step, it now copies both gendered translations, which can’t be pasted into certain fields that have limited characters (Twitter, TikTok, for example). This has become a point of major annoyance, and I find myself often using other translators. I enjoy THIS translator, and have a sense of loyalty to it, despite the absurdity of that, and would love to see copy & paste work only with the gendered translation provided, also excluding the “masculine” and “feminine” indicators, which also gets copied.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n\",\"pub_date\":null},\"context\":\"\"}   \n",

For anything else though including accuracy, definitely use Deepl. Google Translate has come a long way at figuring out Idioms, sayings, the right usage when something is ambiguous, etc. However, Deepl still gets things right more often, especially with the paid version when it can deep dive into things like verification of tone and level of formality for audience where what you have on paper may be 100% correct but may the verb usage is informal but a student is talking to a teacher. This is area Google Translate comes up short. Overall though, 5 stars and definitely far better than any of those other translator apps out there except Deepl.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n\",\"pub_date\":null},\"context\":\"\"}   \n",

The document is the App Store page for Google Translate, providing direct access to download the app, view its features, updates, and user reviews. The content is highly specific to the query intent, directly matching the user's likely need to find or download the Google Translate app. The information is current and contextually appropriate for a user located in the US seeking the iOS version of the app.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Timeliness Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The document reflects the most recent update to the Google Translate app as of December 11, 2024, which is less than a month prior to the query date of January 7, 2025. This indicates that the application is being actively maintained with recent bug fixes and improvements. Although the user reviews showcased are from early 2022, it's reasonable to assume that the App Store page also includes more recent reviews; the presented selection may be a subset. Overall, the content is current and up-to-date, aligning with user expectations for timeliness.\\n* notes: The outdated user reviews included in the content may not reflect the most current user experiences with the app.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" suggests a navigational intent to reach the official Google Translate application, or a transactional intent to download or access the service.

There is no evidence of misinformation or omission of critical information.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## High Stakes\\n* rating: Not High Stake\\n* justification: The document is an App Store page for the Google Translate application, primarily intended for users to download and obtain information about the app. While the translation tool could be used in contexts impacting health, legal matters, or safety, this webpage itself does not provide direct information or services in those High Stake categories. Therefore, the page does not qualify as a High Stake page in terms of content that significantly impacts a person's well-being.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful\\n* justification: The document is an official App Store page for the Google Translate application, providing legitimate information about the app, its updates, and user reviews.

For users seeking to learn about or download the mobile app, the coverage is comprehensive. However, it does not encompass broader information about Google Translate as a service, such as its web interface or integration with other platforms. Therefore, while the coverage is extensive concerning the iOS application, it lacks information about other facets of the service.\\n* notes: The scope of the content is appropriately focused on the app, but users seeking more general information about Google Translate may require additional sources.\\n\\n## User Experience Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The App Store page for Google Translate is designed with user experience in mind, exhibiting a clean layout with clear headings, concise descriptions, and user-friendly navigation.

The provided document is a page from the Apple App Store for the Google Translate app, including details about its features and supported languages. This result directly addresses the query, offering specific and detailed information about the Google Translate app, including how to download it.

However, the publication date is not specified (N/A), making it unclear whether the details are up-to-date as of the query date (January 7, 2025). Given that app features and supported languages can change over time, there is a possibility that the information may be outdated, potentially missing recent updates or new features. Therefore, while the content remains generally relevant, the lack of a clear publication date diminishes its timeliness.\\n* notes: Including a publication or last updated date would improve the assessment of timeliness.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 6\\n* justification: The user's query \"google translate\" suggests a possible navigational intent to access Google's translation service or a transactional intent to download the Google Translate app. The document links to the Apple App Store page for the Google Translate app, enabling users to download the app directly.

This indicates that the application is being actively maintained with recent bug fixes and improvements. Although the user reviews showcased are from early 2022, it's reasonable to assume that the App Store page also includes more recent reviews; the presented selection may be a subset. Overall, the content is current and up-to-date, aligning with user expectations for timeliness.\\n* notes: The outdated user reviews included in the content may not reflect the most current user experiences with the app.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" suggests a navigational intent to reach the official Google Translate application, or a transactional intent to download or access the service.

Therefore, the page does not qualify as a High Stake page in terms of content that significantly impacts a person's well-being.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful\\n* justification: The document is an official App Store page for the Google Translate application, providing legitimate information about the app, its updates, and user reviews.

For users seeking to learn about or download the mobile app, the coverage is comprehensive. However, it does not encompass broader information about Google Translate as a service, such as its web interface or integration with other platforms. Therefore, while the coverage is extensive concerning the iOS application, it lacks information about other facets of the service.\\n* notes: The scope of the content is appropriately focused on the app, but users seeking more general information about Google Translate may require additional sources.\\n\\n## User Experience Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The App Store page for Google Translate is designed with user experience in mind, exhibiting a clean layout with clear headings, concise descriptions, and user-friendly navigation.

However, without explicit confirmation of a recent update, a rating of 6 reflects high timeliness with a slight reservation due to the absence of a clear publication date.\\n* notes: Including specific publication or last updated dates would improve clarity on the timeliness of the content.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" could be interpreted as the user seeking to navigate to the Google Translate app or obtain the app for use. The document is the App Store page for Google Translate, allowing the user to directly download the app. This directly matches transactional intent, enabling the user to complete the intended action efficiently.

However, for a query like \"google translate,\" users might also be interested in information about web-based translation services, download options for other platforms, or general usage instructions.

The provided document is a page from the Apple App Store for the Google Translate app, including details about its features and supported languages. This result directly addresses the query, offering specific and detailed information about the Google Translate app, including how to download it. It aligns with the user's context, particularly if they are using an Apple device, such as an iPhone or iPad.

However, the publication date is not specified (N/A), making it unclear whether the details are up-to-date as of the query date (January 7, 2025). Given that app features and supported languages can change over time, there is a possibility that the information may be outdated, potentially missing recent updates or new features. Therefore, while the content remains generally relevant, the lack of a clear publication date diminishes its timeliness.\\n* notes: Including a publication or last updated date would improve the assessment of timeliness.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 6\\n* justification: The user's query \"google translate\" suggests a possible navigational intent to access Google's translation service or a transactional intent to download the Google Translate app. The document links to the Apple App Store page for the Google Translate app, enabling users to download the app directly. Therefore, it effectively fulfills the transactional intent for users seeking to install the app on an Apple device. However, for users intending to navigate to the Google Translate website for immediate use without installation, this result may be less directly helpful.\\n* notes: The rating assumes the user may be interested in downloading the app; if their intent is solely web-based translation, this might not fully meet their needs.\\n\\n## Geographic & Cultural Relevance\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The document is from the US version of the Apple App Store and is presented in English, aligning perfectly with the user's location in Seattle, USA, and likely cultural context. The content is tailored for users in the United States, ensuring that the application details, availability, and download process are relevant and applicable.

It does not directly involve areas that can significantly impact a person's health, financial stability, safety, or well-being as defined in High Stakes categories like medical advice, financial transactions, or legal information. Therefore, this page does not qualify as a High Stake page.\\n* notes:\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful (7)\\n* justification: The content is an official listing for the Google Translate app on the Apple App Store, providing information about the app's features, permissions, and supported languages.

It’s had many wonderful improvements over the years. However, since the update giving masculine/feminine translations for gendered languages, copy & paste has been ruined for me.\\n> Previously, the app would often predict needed gendered letters/words based on other words being translated, and a simple copy & paste almost always the immediately available next step, it now copies both gendered translations, which can’t be pasted into certain fields that have limited characters (Twitter, TikTok, for example). This has become a point of major annoyance, and I find myself often using other translators. I enjoy THIS translator, and have a sense of loyalty to it, despite the absurdity of that, and would love to see copy & paste work only with the gendered translation provided, also excluding the “masculine” and “feminine” indicators, which also gets copied.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n   \n",

It has gotten much better over time to the point that I can reasonable rely on it to doble check things. If you need real time transcription, Google Translate is the best. For anything else though including accuracy, definitely use Deepl. Google Translate has come a long way at figuring out Idioms, sayings, the right usage when something is ambiguous, etc. However, Deepl still gets things right more often, especially with the paid version when it can deep dive into things like verification of tone and level of formality for audience where what you have on paper may be 100% correct but may the verb usage is informal but a student is talking to a teacher. This is area Google Translate comes up short. Overall though, 5 stars and definitely far better than any of those other translator apps out there except Deepl.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n   \n",
