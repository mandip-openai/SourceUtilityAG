It’s had many wonderful improvements over the years. However, since the update giving masculine/feminine translations for gendered languages, copy & paste has been ruined for me.\\n> Previously, the app would often predict needed gendered letters/words based on other words being translated, and a simple copy & paste almost always the immediately available next step, it now copies both gendered translations, which can’t be pasted into certain fields that have limited characters (Twitter, TikTok, for example). This has become a point of major annoyance, and I find myself often using other translators. I enjoy THIS translator, and have a sense of loyalty to it, despite the absurdity of that, and would love to see copy & paste work only with the gendered translation provided, also excluding the “masculine” and “feminine” indicators, which also gets copied.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n\",\"pub_date\":null},\"context\":\"\"}   \n",

For anything else though including accuracy, definitely use Deepl. Google Translate has come a long way at figuring out Idioms, sayings, the right usage when something is ambiguous, etc. However, Deepl still gets things right more often, especially with the paid version when it can deep dive into things like verification of tone and level of formality for audience where what you have on paper may be 100% correct but may the verb usage is informal but a student is talking to a teacher. This is area Google Translate comes up short. Overall though, 5 stars and definitely far better than any of those other translator apps out there except Deepl.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n\",\"pub_date\":null},\"context\":\"\"}   \n",

The document is the App Store page for Google Translate, providing direct access to download the app, view its features, updates, and user reviews. The content is highly specific to the query intent, directly matching the user's likely need to find or download the Google Translate app. The information is current and contextually appropriate for a user located in the US seeking the iOS version of the app.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Timeliness Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The document reflects the most recent update to the Google Translate app as of December 11, 2024, which is less than a month prior to the query date of January 7, 2025. This indicates that the application is being actively maintained with recent bug fixes and improvements. Although the user reviews showcased are from early 2022, it's reasonable to assume that the App Store page also includes more recent reviews; the presented selection may be a subset. Overall, the content is current and up-to-date, aligning with user expectations for timeliness.\\n* notes: The outdated user reviews included in the content may not reflect the most current user experiences with the app.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" suggests a navigational intent to reach the official Google Translate application, or a transactional intent to download or access the service.

There is no evidence of misinformation or omission of critical information.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## High Stakes\\n* rating: Not High Stake\\n* justification: The document is an App Store page for the Google Translate application, primarily intended for users to download and obtain information about the app. While the translation tool could be used in contexts impacting health, legal matters, or safety, this webpage itself does not provide direct information or services in those High Stake categories. Therefore, the page does not qualify as a High Stake page in terms of content that significantly impacts a person's well-being.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful\\n* justification: The document is an official App Store page for the Google Translate application, providing legitimate information about the app, its updates, and user reviews.

For users seeking to learn about or download the mobile app, the coverage is comprehensive. However, it does not encompass broader information about Google Translate as a service, such as its web interface or integration with other platforms. Therefore, while the coverage is extensive concerning the iOS application, it lacks information about other facets of the service.\\n* notes: The scope of the content is appropriately focused on the app, but users seeking more general information about Google Translate may require additional sources.\\n\\n## User Experience Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The App Store page for Google Translate is designed with user experience in mind, exhibiting a clean layout with clear headings, concise descriptions, and user-friendly navigation.

The provided document is a page from the Apple App Store for the Google Translate app, including details about its features and supported languages. This result directly addresses the query, offering specific and detailed information about the Google Translate app, including how to download it.

However, the publication date is not specified (N/A), making it unclear whether the details are up-to-date as of the query date (January 7, 2025). Given that app features and supported languages can change over time, there is a possibility that the information may be outdated, potentially missing recent updates or new features. Therefore, while the content remains generally relevant, the lack of a clear publication date diminishes its timeliness.\\n* notes: Including a publication or last updated date would improve the assessment of timeliness.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 6\\n* justification: The user's query \"google translate\" suggests a possible navigational intent to access Google's translation service or a transactional intent to download the Google Translate app. The document links to the Apple App Store page for the Google Translate app, enabling users to download the app directly.

This indicates that the application is being actively maintained with recent bug fixes and improvements. Although the user reviews showcased are from early 2022, it's reasonable to assume that the App Store page also includes more recent reviews; the presented selection may be a subset. Overall, the content is current and up-to-date, aligning with user expectations for timeliness.\\n* notes: The outdated user reviews included in the content may not reflect the most current user experiences with the app.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" suggests a navigational intent to reach the official Google Translate application, or a transactional intent to download or access the service.

Therefore, the page does not qualify as a High Stake page in terms of content that significantly impacts a person's well-being.\\n* notes: None.\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful\\n* justification: The document is an official App Store page for the Google Translate application, providing legitimate information about the app, its updates, and user reviews.

For users seeking to learn about or download the mobile app, the coverage is comprehensive. However, it does not encompass broader information about Google Translate as a service, such as its web interface or integration with other platforms. Therefore, while the coverage is extensive concerning the iOS application, it lacks information about other facets of the service.\\n* notes: The scope of the content is appropriately focused on the app, but users seeking more general information about Google Translate may require additional sources.\\n\\n## User Experience Evaluation\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The App Store page for Google Translate is designed with user experience in mind, exhibiting a clean layout with clear headings, concise descriptions, and user-friendly navigation.

However, without explicit confirmation of a recent update, a rating of 6 reflects high timeliness with a slight reservation due to the absence of a clear publication date.\\n* notes: Including specific publication or last updated dates would improve clarity on the timeliness of the content.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The query \"google translate\" could be interpreted as the user seeking to navigate to the Google Translate app or obtain the app for use. The document is the App Store page for Google Translate, allowing the user to directly download the app. This directly matches transactional intent, enabling the user to complete the intended action efficiently.

However, for a query like \"google translate,\" users might also be interested in information about web-based translation services, download options for other platforms, or general usage instructions.

The provided document is a page from the Apple App Store for the Google Translate app, including details about its features and supported languages. This result directly addresses the query, offering specific and detailed information about the Google Translate app, including how to download it. It aligns with the user's context, particularly if they are using an Apple device, such as an iPhone or iPad.

However, the publication date is not specified (N/A), making it unclear whether the details are up-to-date as of the query date (January 7, 2025). Given that app features and supported languages can change over time, there is a possibility that the information may be outdated, potentially missing recent updates or new features. Therefore, while the content remains generally relevant, the lack of a clear publication date diminishes its timeliness.\\n* notes: Including a publication or last updated date would improve the assessment of timeliness.\\n\\n## Navigational or Transactional\\n* rating: 6\\n* justification: The user's query \"google translate\" suggests a possible navigational intent to access Google's translation service or a transactional intent to download the Google Translate app. The document links to the Apple App Store page for the Google Translate app, enabling users to download the app directly. Therefore, it effectively fulfills the transactional intent for users seeking to install the app on an Apple device. However, for users intending to navigate to the Google Translate website for immediate use without installation, this result may be less directly helpful.\\n* notes: The rating assumes the user may be interested in downloading the app; if their intent is solely web-based translation, this might not fully meet their needs.\\n\\n## Geographic & Cultural Relevance\\n* rating: 7\\n* justification: The document is from the US version of the Apple App Store and is presented in English, aligning perfectly with the user's location in Seattle, USA, and likely cultural context. The content is tailored for users in the United States, ensuring that the application details, availability, and download process are relevant and applicable.

It does not directly involve areas that can significantly impact a person's health, financial stability, safety, or well-being as defined in High Stakes categories like medical advice, financial transactions, or legal information. Therefore, this page does not qualify as a High Stake page.\\n* notes:\\n\\n## Harmful\\n* rating: Not Harmful (7)\\n* justification: The content is an official listing for the Google Translate app on the Apple App Store, providing information about the app's features, permissions, and supported languages.

It’s had many wonderful improvements over the years. However, since the update giving masculine/feminine translations for gendered languages, copy & paste has been ruined for me.\\n> Previously, the app would often predict needed gendered letters/words based on other words being translated, and a simple copy & paste almost always the immediately available next step, it now copies both gendered translations, which can’t be pasted into certain fields that have limited characters (Twitter, TikTok, for example). This has become a point of major annoyance, and I find myself often using other translators. I enjoy THIS translator, and have a sense of loyalty to it, despite the absurdity of that, and would love to see copy & paste work only with the gendered translation provided, also excluding the “masculine” and “feminine” indicators, which also gets copied.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n   \n",

It has gotten much better over time to the point that I can reasonable rely on it to doble check things. If you need real time transcription, Google Translate is the best. For anything else though including accuracy, definitely use Deepl. Google Translate has come a long way at figuring out Idioms, sayings, the right usage when something is ambiguous, etc. However, Deepl still gets things right more often, especially with the paid version when it can deep dive into things like verification of tone and level of formality for audience where what you have on paper may be 100% correct but may the verb usage is informal but a student is talking to a teacher. This is area Google Translate comes up short. Overall though, 5 stars and definitely far better than any of those other translator apps out there except Deepl.\\n\\nMTLima1995 , 02/24/2022\\n\\n### Horrible Application Given the Size of the Company\\n\\n> The Google translate app is a joke. There are very few apps that can lead someone to yell expletives while sitting in their kitchen trying to enjoy a cup of tea. Editing something you’ve written on the Google Translate App is a pitiful process filled with tapping the screen of your phone over and over attempting to unselect individual words or sentences. Sometimes it selects the entirety of what you’ve written and won’t allow you to unselect it without a fight. It’s unconscionable that the process for editing what you’ve written doesn’t follow every other smart phone format. Not only that, when you’ve finished writing of considerable length, in my case an email, and would like to highlight, copy and paste it, you will quickly realize you cannot highlight and scroll at the same time like you can on any other apple app that includes type. Instead, you’re forced to go through a ridiculous process of highlighting as much as you can see, pasting it, returning to the app, copying more and then pasting that. I repeated that process six time before I had copied my email over to gmail. If I had more time I would go into detail about the “define” tool that pops up unprovoked and further adds to the absolute farce that is the UX of this application. For a company like Google to have produced such a dysfunctional infuriating UI is truly shameful.\\n\\nwhsbflfirhdbskabbd , 02/03/2022\\n\\n### This used to be excellent. Google lens made it terrible!\\n\\n> As usual an update makes the produce worse instead of better. I live in a foreign country because of my husbands job. I use this app everyday. ALL THE TIME! Before, I could use the camera option to translate in real time or take a picture and let it scan for text. Then I could choose which text to translate, it could be 1 word or 1 sentence or 1 paragraph or the whole thing. The lastest update removed this option. Now when I click on the camera option it says “Google lens” it automatically blocks out the original texts and puts the translation over it, like it did previously but now when I take the picture I can not scan the text and choose what part to translate. It simply takes a screen shot of the translation already made on the first screen. If I try to select a specific word, it selects the translation and then translates it back into the original language. This does work well! The meaning gets more and more mixed up until it just makes no sense at all. Translating a translation instead of just scanning the original text is a huge downgrade. I am so frustrated! I am going to start looking for other translators because this has caused a lot of issues for me, on a daily basis. I’ll keep checking back to see if they ever fix this issue or not.\\n\\n   \n",

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【4†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【5†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.

DeSantis wrote on social media, blaming Harris for what he called \"the worst border crisis in American history.\"\\n\\n\"Democrats are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" DeSantis wrote.\\n\\n## Rep.

Stefanik, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, also claimed that Mr. Biden's announcement shows he isn't fit to currently serve as president. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States,\" Stefanik said in a statement, urging Mr. Biden to \"immediately resign.\"\\n\\n\"Every elected Democrat in America owns Joe Biden's failed and feckless record causing the border crisis, Bidenflation, and chaos and weakness around the world,\" she wrote. \"President Trump will win this November to save America.\"\\n\\nLater Sunday, Stefanik wrote on social media that she planned to introduce a resolution Monday that condemned Harris' role in what she called \"the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah\\n\\n【9†Sen. Romney】, who was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement that while he and Mr. Biden differed on many issues, the president has his respect.\\n\\n\"I'm a classic Republican and he's a classic Democrat; obviously, President Biden and I usually didn't see eye-to-eye. I opposed many of his initiatives. But we did find common ground on infrastructure, Ukraine, the Electoral Count Act, adding religious liberty protections to the marriage bill, gun safety measures, and chip manufacturing,\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"Others will judge his presidency. However, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Steve Daines of Montana\\n\\nSen. Daines formally called on Mr. Biden to resign, saying the president \"is no longer capable of serving as President.\"\\n\\n\"Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,\" Daines said in a statement. \"It is out of concern for our country's national security that I am formally calling on President Biden to resign from office.\"\\n\\n\"It has also been striking that none of the Senate Democrats who served with Vice President Harris have called for her to replace President Biden,\" Daines added, saying he had doubts about Harris's ability to serve as president. \\n\\n   \n",

JD Vance of Ohio\\n\\n\"Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way,\" 【7†Sen. JD Vance】, the Republican 【8†nominee for vice president】, wrote on social media late Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n\"Over the last four years she co-signed Biden's open border and green scam policies that drove up the cost of housing and groceries,\" Vance wrote. \"She owns all of these failures, and she lied for nearly four years about Biden's mental capacity--saddling the nation with a president who can't do the job. President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on.\"\\n\\n## Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana\\n\\nHouse Speaker Johnson said Mr. Biden's announcement posed \"an unprecedented juncture in American history\" and claimed the president's decision invalidated the votes of millions of Americans who selected Biden as the Democratic nominee. \\n\\n\"The party's prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden Administration,\" Johnson said in a statement, calling on Mr. Biden to resign immediately. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\" Johnson wrote, adding, \"November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\\n\\n\"For four years, the American people have faced historic inflation at home, chaos at the border, and weak leadership on the world stage,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. \"Our nation is less prosperous and less secure than it was in January, 2021. We cannot afford four more years of failure.\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country,\" McConnell added. \"Washington Democrats have not proven themselves any more capable than the President of delivering the secure borders, safe streets, and stable prices that working families deserve.\"\\n\\n## Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise claimed that Democratic party leaders had \"absolutely no respect for their own voters.\"\\n\\n\"After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters,\" Scalise said in a statement.\\n\\n\"For years, Democrats and their partners in the media maligned Americans who questioned the President's fitness based on what they saw with their own eyes as conspiracy theorists,\" Scalise wrote. \"Every single one of these people - especially Vice President Harris - who participated in this cover up must answer for their involvement.\"\\n\\n   \n",

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n   \n",

Tate Reeves\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen a politician so strong and talented he made his opponent quit in the middle of the race? I have: Donald J. Trump,\" Gov. Reeves quipped on social media. \\n\\n## Trump presidential campaign\\n\\nIn a strongly worded statement earlier Sunday, senior Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles called Mr. Biden \"weak, pathetic, and incompetent.\"\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris is just as much of joke as Biden is,\" the advisers wrote. \"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden. Harris has been the Enabler in Chief for Crooked Joe this entire time. They own each other's records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\\n\\n\"Biden is a national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman, and child in our country,\" they added. \"The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?\"\\n\\n## Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden,\" Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote to CBS News. \"The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.\"\\n\\n### Election 2024\\n\\n【11†More】\\n\\n【12†Watch a full replay of the Vance-Walz VP debate】\\n\\n【13†Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown】\\n\\n【14†Who won the VP debate?

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\\n\\nAt the start of his statement, Trump also called Biden \"the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.\"\\n\\nThe former president's campaign immediately began a new fundraising push following Biden's announcement, writing, \"But RIGHT NOW, he just quit the race in COMPLETE DISGRACE!\"\\n\\n【2†MORE: Read Joe Biden's full letter announcing he's leaving 2024 race】\\n\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson 【3†wrote on X†twitter.com】, \"At this unprecedented juncture in American history, we must be clear about what just happened.

We cannot afford four more years of failure.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country. Washington Democrats have not proven themselves any more capable than the President of delivering the secure borders, safe streets, and stable prices that working families deserve. They are selling open borders, higher prices, climate radicalism, and soft-on-crime policies, and the American people are not buying,\" McConnell's statement concluded.\\n\\nTrump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, on behalf of the former president's campaign, issued a statement slamming Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is a complete fraud and a disgrace to our Country,\" they said in their statement. …\\n\\nThey continued, \"And during this entire term, Kamala Harris – as well as every other Democrat in Washington, sat by and did NOTHING.

Biden’s decision is also likely to raise questions about his ability to fulfill the duties of the presidency for the remainder of his term.\\n\\nIt’s the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s announcement. \\n\\nIt’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.\\n\\nBut not even the attempted assassination and its tumultuous effect on the race could pause the loss of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.\\n\\n## Exclusive: Trump responds to Biden dropping out\\n\\nFrom CNN's Kaitlan Collins\\n\\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Donald Trump described Biden going “down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.” \\n\\nWhile it’s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be, Trump said he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. \\n\\n## NRCC chairman describes Biden's decision as a \"scandal of historic proportions\"\\n\\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju\\n\\nThe head of the House GOP’s campaign arm, Richard Hudson, called President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential campaign a “scandal of historic proportions.”\\n\\n“Our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust,” he said.\\n\\nHudson questioned the ability of Biden to continue the remainder of his presidential campaign.\\n\\n“If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes.

Steve Ricchetti, another longtime adviser going back to his time as vice president, was charged with organizing the mechanics of the announcement. Both are in Rehoboth with Biden. \\n\\nBiden’s closest advisers and family were told of his decision on Saturday night as he put in motion the process of drafting the letter and the mechanics of its release. \\n\\nHe has spoken to all of his family since making the decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier today, according to the source.\\n\\nIt is unclear if other family will join the Bidens in Delaware as the president continues to recover from Covid-19.\\n\\n## Biden campaign co-chair supports Harris\\n\\nFrom CNN's Maureen Chowdhury\\n\\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons, long-time ally of Joe Biden and his campaign co-chair, said he supports Vice President Kamala Harris for replacing the president on the Democratic ticket.\\n\\nCoons described Harris as a “genuine leader” and said that he is “glad that President Biden has endorsed her today and made it clear the direction that he intends to take as the most respected senior leader in our party this fall. He was determined to beat Donald Trump and to make sure that the hard work he and Kamala Harris have done, leading our country this last four years, continues.”\\n\\nAs for Biden’s decision to step down, Coons noted that, “This is a historic moment, where our president is choosing to step aside in the best interest of the nation. And that is in the best tradition of Joe Biden’s life of putting our nation before himself.”\\n\\n## Harris says she will \"earn and win\" Democratic nomination\\n\\nFrom CNN's Betsy Klein\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement she was “honored” to receive President Joe Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.\\n\\n“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said. \\n\\nThis statement was issued from the Biden-Harris campaign side, not the White House.\\n\\nShe vowed to “do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” \\n\\nHarris offered her thanks and praise to Biden for his service, heralding his legacy and the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n\\n“With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,” Harris said. \\n\\nThere are 107 days until Election Day, she noted, an acknowledgment of the very short period of time for Harris to consolidate her party’s support. \\n\\n“Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,” she said.\\n\\nThis post has been updated with more from Harris’ statement.\\n\\n   \n",

How did we get here? \\n\\nFrom CNN's Antoinette Radford\\n\\nThe calls for President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 race grew louder and louder over the past month, triggered by a shaky performance at the CNN presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee.\\n\\nDuring that debate, Biden often 【140†defaulted to an open-mouthed】, staring look while Trump was speaking. The president occasionally struggled to finish his thoughts or land punches, ceding ground on issues such as abortion where Democrats have an edge.\\n\\nIt had a significant impact on public confidence in the president, with his approval rating hitting a new low following the debate, according to a 【159†CNN poll conducted by SSRS†s3.documentcloud.org】. \\n\\nThat same poll found that three-quarters of US voters said the Democratic Party would have a better shot at holding the presidency in 2024 with someone other than 【12†Biden】 at the top of the ticket.\\n\\nAfter the dismal debate performance, the president had a new challenge showing both international leaders and voters at home that he was up to the top job as leaders gathered in Washington for the NATO conference. In a crucial speech, Biden’s first solo press conference 【160†since November 2023】, the president referred to 【161†Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky】 as Vladimir Putin — the name of the Russian president.\\n\\nAgain, public confidence in Biden plummeted.

Here's what you should know about the historic events today\\n\\nFrom CNN staff\\n\\nIn an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Read【13†more here】 about how the president came to his decision.\\n\\nHere are the key things to know:\\n\\n  * Biden wrote in a letter 【70†posted†twitter.com】 to his official account on X: “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\\n  * Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail. A senior White House official said his decision to withdrawl did not have to do with any medical issues.\\n  * In 【71†a follow-up post,†x.com】 Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her.\\n  * Biden has spent Sunday talking to 【72†members of Congress】, governors and supporters. The plans for Biden to 【61†exit the 2024】 race were set into motion last night and 【73†finalized today】, a source familiar with the matter said.\\n  * The president is still recovering from 【74†a Covid-19 diagnosis】 and has remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend.\\n\\nHow we got here: Age had been Biden’s biggest political weakness ever since he launched his first campaign against former President Donald Trump five years ago. After his faltering performance at CNN’s debate on June 27, a growing number of Democrats called on the president to step aside in the 2024 race even as Biden held a slew of events aiming to prove his fitness for office. 【31†Check out the full timeline】.\\n\\nWhat happens next: The Democratic Party will need to 【75†choose a new nominee】. That decision will ultimately be made by the roughly 4,700 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Either during a 【62†virtual roll call】, which is tentatively planned for early August, or at the convention in Chicago beginning August 19, these delegates will select any eligible candidate to be the party’s nominee. Learn about what could happen next 【58†here】.\\n\\nWhat about campaign money: According to the Campaign Legal Center, the campaign war chest — totaling 【76†$95.9 million at the end of June】 — would be directly available to the Democrats’ presidential ticket for use in the general election only if Harris is the party’s nominee or vice presidential nominee. If Harris does not end up on Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the existing campaign account could be converted into a political action committee and use its funds indirectly.\\n\\nKamala Harris in the spotlight\\n\\n  * Harris said she was 【77†“honored”】 to receive Biden’s endorsement and intended to “earn and win” the nomination. She vowed to “do everything in my power to 【15†unite the Democratic Party”】 and thanked Biden for the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n  * Various 【78†lawmakers】 have already【79† endorsed her】. The Biden campaign leadership also 【65†voiced support】 for Harris on an all-staff call. Donors have also indicated they are 【80†prepared to back Harris】.\\n  * Trump’s allies are 【81†launching attack ads】 targeting Harris, previewing sharp criticism and targeting key battleground states.\\n  * Another possible contender: Sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia independent, said he’s considering re-registering as a Democrat and 【18†throwing his hat into the ring】 to run for president.\\n\\nKey reactions\\n\\n  * First lady Dr. Jill Biden 【82†offered her support】 for whatever decision he chose, according to her communications director. Biden’s son Hunter praised his father’s 【83†lifetime of public service】.\\n  * Former President 【84†Barack Obama】 expressed his support for Biden, describing him as “a patriot of the highest order.”\\n  * Various Democratic 【85†lawmakers】, 【86†governors, mayors】 and 【87†international leaders】 have also released messages thanking and praising Biden’s time in office.\\n\\n   \n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【4†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【5†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【6†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Youngkin wrote on social media late Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nHe called on the nation to come together \"to secure our borders, structure safe communities, grow an economy that lifts up all Americans and restores peace through strength.\"\\n\\n## Mississippi Gov.

Reeves quipped on social media. \\n\\n## Trump presidential campaign\\n\\nIn a strongly worded statement earlier Sunday, senior Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles called Mr. Biden \"weak, pathetic, and incompetent.\"\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris is just as much of joke as Biden is,\" the advisers wrote. \"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden. Harris has been the Enabler in Chief for Crooked Joe this entire time. They own each other's records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\\n\\n\"Biden is a national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman, and child in our country,\" they added. \"The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?\"\\n\\n## Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden,\" Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote to CBS News. \"The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.\"\\n\\n### Election 2024\\n\\n【11†More】\\n\\n【12†Watch a full replay of the Vance-Walz VP debate】\\n\\n【13†Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown】\\n\\n【14†Who won the VP debate?

DeSantis wrote on social media, blaming Harris for what he called \"the worst border crisis in American history.\"\\n\\n\"Democrats are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" DeSantis wrote.\\n\\n## Rep.

Elise Stefanik of New York\\n\\nRep. Stefanik, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, also claimed that Mr. Biden's announcement shows he isn't fit to currently serve as president. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States,\" Stefanik said in a statement, urging Mr. Biden to \"immediately resign.\"\\n\\n\"Every elected Democrat in America owns Joe Biden's failed and feckless record causing the border crisis, Bidenflation, and chaos and weakness around the world,\" she wrote. \"President Trump will win this November to save America.\"\\n\\nLater Sunday, Stefanik wrote on social media that she planned to introduce a resolution Monday that condemned Harris' role in what she called \"the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.\"\\n\\n## Sen.

Romney】, who was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement that while he and Mr. Biden differed on many issues, the president has his respect.\\n\\n\"I'm a classic Republican and he's a classic Democrat; obviously, President Biden and I usually didn't see eye-to-eye. I opposed many of his initiatives. But we did find common ground on infrastructure, Ukraine, the Electoral Count Act, adding religious liberty protections to the marriage bill, gun safety measures, and chip manufacturing,\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"Others will judge his presidency. However, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Steve Daines of Montana\\n\\nSen. Daines formally called on Mr. Biden to resign, saying the president \"is no longer capable of serving as President.\"\\n\\n\"Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,\" Daines said in a statement. \"It is out of concern for our country's national security that I am formally calling on President Biden to resign from office.\"\\n\\n\"It has also been striking that none of the Senate Democrats who served with Vice President Harris have called for her to replace President Biden,\" Daines added, saying he had doubts about Harris's ability to serve as president. \\n\\n</td>\n",

Biden’s decision is also likely to raise questions about his ability to fulfill the duties of the presidency for the remainder of his term.\\n\\nIt’s the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s announcement. \\n\\nIt’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.\\n\\nBut not even the attempted assassination and its tumultuous effect on the race could pause the loss of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.\\n\\n## Exclusive: Trump responds to Biden dropping out\\n\\nFrom CNN's Kaitlan Collins\\n\\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Donald Trump described Biden going “down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.” \\n\\nWhile it’s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be, Trump said he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. \\n\\n## NRCC chairman describes Biden's decision as a \"scandal of historic proportions\"\\n\\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju\\n\\nThe head of the House GOP’s campaign arm, Richard Hudson, called President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential campaign a “scandal of historic proportions.”\\n\\n“Our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust,” he said.\\n\\nHudson questioned the ability of Biden to continue the remainder of his presidential campaign.\\n\\n“If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?”\\n\\n## Biden announces he will not seek reelection\\n\\nFrom CNN's Sam Fossum\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden 【61†announced he will not seek reelection】 amid continued pressure following a disastrous debate performance last month that left many in his party questioning whether he should continue to seek reelection. He will serve out the remainder of his term.\\n\\n“And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter he posted on his 【184†X account.†x.com】\\n\\nHe added: “I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”\\n\\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” he wrote.\\n\\nThis post has been updated with additional updates on Biden’s announcement.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Chris Coons, long-time ally of Joe Biden and his campaign co-chair, said he supports Vice President Kamala Harris for replacing the president on the Democratic ticket.\\n\\nCoons described Harris as a “genuine leader” and said that he is “glad that President Biden has endorsed her today and made it clear the direction that he intends to take as the most respected senior leader in our party this fall. He was determined to beat Donald Trump and to make sure that the hard work he and Kamala Harris have done, leading our country this last four years, continues.”\\n\\nAs for Biden’s decision to step down, Coons noted that, “This is a historic moment, where our president is choosing to step aside in the best interest of the nation. And that is in the best tradition of Joe Biden’s life of putting our nation before himself.”\\n\\n## Harris says she will \"earn and win\" Democratic nomination\\n\\nFrom CNN's Betsy Klein\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement she was “honored” to receive President Joe Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.\\n\\n“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said. \\n\\nThis statement was issued from the Biden-Harris campaign side, not the White House.\\n\\nShe vowed to “do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” \\n\\nHarris offered her thanks and praise to Biden for his service, heralding his legacy and the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n\\n“With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,” Harris said. \\n\\nThere are 107 days until Election Day, she noted, an acknowledgment of the very short period of time for Harris to consolidate her party’s support. \\n\\n“Together, we will fight.

              "      <td>## Biden has stepped down as presidential candidate just months out from the election. How did we get here? \\n\\nFrom CNN's Antoinette Radford\\n\\nThe calls for President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 race grew louder and louder over the past month, triggered by a shaky performance at the CNN presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee.\\n\\nDuring that debate, Biden often 【140†defaulted to an open-mouthed】, staring look while Trump was speaking. The president occasionally struggled to finish his thoughts or land punches, ceding ground on issues such as abortion where Democrats have an edge.\\n\\nIt had a significant impact on public confidence in the president, with his approval rating hitting a new low following the debate, according to a 【159†CNN poll conducted by SSRS†s3.documentcloud.org】. \\n\\nThat same poll found that three-quarters of US voters said the Democratic Party would have a better shot at holding the presidency in 2024 with someone other than 【12†Biden】 at the top of the ticket.\\n\\nAfter the dismal debate performance, the president had a new challenge showing both international leaders and voters at home that he was up to the top job as leaders gathered in Washington for the NATO conference. In a crucial speech, Biden’s first solo press conference 【160†since November 2023】, the president referred to 【161†Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky】 as Vladimir Putin — the name of the Russian president.\\n\\nAgain, public confidence in Biden plummeted. And the news only got worse for the 81-year-old president when he 【74†tested positive to Covid-19】 on Wednesday.\\n\\nAmid concerns about his physical and mental capabilities in the role, Biden remained steadfast: He would not exit the race.\\n\\nBy Thursday, even the 【30†most senior-ranking White House officials】 privately believed Biden needed to abandon his campaign for a second term, and to do it soon.\\n\\nSenior Democrat Nancy Pelosi weighed in on the matter, 【162†privately telling Biden】 that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November.\\n\\nAnd on Sunday morning, hours before Biden announced his decision to step down, 【96†independent Sen. Joe Manchin】 echoed other lawmakers in encouraging Biden to “pass the torch” to a new generation of leadership.\\n\\nCNN’s Betsy Klein, Kasie Hunt, MJ Lee, Lauren Fox and Kayla Tausche contributed to this post.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>## Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race. Here's what you should know about the historic events today\\n\\nFrom CNN staff\\n\\nIn an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Read【13†more here】 about how the president came to his decision.\\n\\nHere are the key things to know:\\n\\n  * Biden wrote in a letter 【70†posted†twitter.com】 to his official account on X: “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\\n  * Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail. A senior White House official said his decision to withdrawl did not have to do with any medical issues.\\n  * In 【71†a follow-up post,†x.com】 Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her.\\n  * Biden has spent Sunday talking to 【72†members of Congress】, governors and supporters. The plans for Biden to 【61†exit the 2024】 race were set into motion last night and 【73†finalized today】, a source familiar with the matter said.\\n  * The president is still recovering from 【74†a Covid-19 diagnosis】 and has remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend.\\n\\nHow we got here: Age had been Biden’s biggest political weakness ever since he launched his first campaign against former President Donald Trump five years ago. After his faltering performance at CNN’s debate on June 27, a growing number of Democrats called on the president to step aside in the 2024 race even as Biden held a slew of events aiming to prove his fitness for office. 【31†Check out the full timeline】.\\n\\nWhat happens next: The Democratic Party will need to 【75†choose a new nominee】. That decision will ultimately be made by the roughly 4,700 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Either during a 【62†virtual roll call】, which is tentatively planned for early August, or at the convention in Chicago beginning August 19, these delegates will select any eligible candidate to be the party’s nominee. Learn about what could happen next 【58†here】.\\n\\nWhat about campaign money: According to the Campaign Legal Center, the campaign war chest — totaling 【76†$95.9 million at the end of June】 — would be directly available to the Democrats’ presidential ticket for use in the general election only if Harris is the party’s nominee or vice presidential nominee. If Harris does not end up on Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the existing campaign account could be converted into a political action committee and use its funds indirectly.\\n\\nKamala Harris in the spotlight\\n\\n  * Harris said she was 【77†“honored”】 to receive Biden’s endorsement and intended to “earn and win” the nomination. She vowed to “do everything in my power to 【15†unite the Democratic Party”】 and thanked Biden for the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n  * Various 【78†lawmakers】 have already【79† endorsed her】. The Biden campaign leadership also 【65†voiced support】 for Harris on an all-staff call. Donors have also indicated they are 【80†prepared to back Harris】.\\n  * Trump’s allies are 【81†launching attack ads】 targeting Harris, previewing sharp criticism and targeting key battleground states.\\n  * Another possible contender: Sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia independent, said he’s considering re-registering as a Democrat and 【18†throwing his hat into the ring】 to run for president.\\n\\nKey reactions\\n\\n  * First lady Dr. Jill Biden 【82†offered her support】 for whatever decision he chose, according to her communications director. Biden’s son Hunter praised his father’s 【83†lifetime of public service】.\\n  * Former President 【84†Barack Obama】 expressed his support for Biden, describing him as “a patriot of the highest order.”\\n  * Various Democratic 【85†lawmakers】, 【86†governors, mayors】 and 【87†international leaders】 have also released messages thanking and praising Biden’s time in office.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Instead, they vote for 538 officials, who are allocated to American states based on their population size.\\n\\nExplaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins\\n\\nThe electors almost always vote for the candidate who won the most votes in their states, and although it is possible for some to disregard the voters' pick, no result has ever been changed this way.\\n\\nMr Trump also said that he was planning to hold a rally in Georgia on Saturday in support of two Republicans in key runoff elections that will decide which party controls the Senate. The elections in Georgia are due to be held on 5 January.\\n\\n## What's the latest from Biden?\\n\\nThe president-elect celebrated a quiet Thanksgiving on Thursday, as coronavirus cases in the US continue to rise.\\n\\n\"This year, our turkey will be smaller and the clatter of cooking a little quieter,\" 【11†Mr Biden and his wife Jill said in an op-ed published by CNN†edition.cnn.com】. \"Like millions of Americans, we are temporarily letting go of the traditions we can't do safely.\\n\\n\"It is not a small sacrifice. These moments with our loved ones - time that's lost - can't be returned. Yet, we know it's the price of protecting each other and one we don't pay alone.\"\\n\\n\"We're at war with a virus, not with one another\": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19\\n\\nEarlier this week, Mr Biden urged Americans to hold smaller celebrations, saying: \"I know that we can and will beat this virus.\" He has said that tackling the pandemic will be his main priority when he takes office.\\n\\n【12†Mr Biden has already nominated a number of top officials†www.bbc.co.uk】 for when he takes over and said that co-operation from the White House over the transition had been \"sincere\".\\n\\nSpeaking in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, he said that the US \"won't stand\" for any attempt to derail the election. Americans \"have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,\" he said.\\n\\n【13†Trump accepts transition to Biden must begin】\\n\\n【14†Why does US presidential transition matter?】\\n\\n【15†What Biden's new team tells us】\\n\\n【16†Legal battles looming for Trump】\\n\\n【17†'To my Republican friends'】\\n\\n【18†Five reasons Biden won】\\n\\n【19†Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last】\\n\\n* * *</td>\n",

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【4†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【5†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.

DeSantis wrote on social media, blaming Harris for what he called \"the worst border crisis in American history.\"\\n\\n\"Democrats are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" DeSantis wrote.\\n\\n## Rep.

Stefanik, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, also claimed that Mr. Biden's announcement shows he isn't fit to currently serve as president. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States,\" Stefanik said in a statement, urging Mr. Biden to \"immediately resign.\"\\n\\n\"Every elected Democrat in America owns Joe Biden's failed and feckless record causing the border crisis, Bidenflation, and chaos and weakness around the world,\" she wrote. \"President Trump will win this November to save America.\"\\n\\nLater Sunday, Stefanik wrote on social media that she planned to introduce a resolution Monday that condemned Harris' role in what she called \"the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah\\n\\n【9†Sen. Romney】, who was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said in a statement that while he and Mr. Biden differed on many issues, the president has his respect.\\n\\n\"I'm a classic Republican and he's a classic Democrat; obviously, President Biden and I usually didn't see eye-to-eye. I opposed many of his initiatives. But we did find common ground on infrastructure, Ukraine, the Electoral Count Act, adding religious liberty protections to the marriage bill, gun safety measures, and chip manufacturing,\" he wrote.\\n\\n\"Others will judge his presidency. However, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Steve Daines of Montana\\n\\nSen. Daines formally called on Mr. Biden to resign, saying the president \"is no longer capable of serving as President.\"\\n\\n\"Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,\" Daines said in a statement. \"It is out of concern for our country's national security that I am formally calling on President Biden to resign from office.\"\\n\\n\"It has also been striking that none of the Senate Democrats who served with Vice President Harris have called for her to replace President Biden,\" Daines added, saying he had doubts about Harris's ability to serve as president. \\n\\n   \n",

JD Vance of Ohio\\n\\n\"Joe Biden has been the worst President in my lifetime and Kamala Harris has been right there with him every step of the way,\" 【7†Sen. JD Vance】, the Republican 【8†nominee for vice president】, wrote on social media late Sunday afternoon.\\n\\n\"Over the last four years she co-signed Biden's open border and green scam policies that drove up the cost of housing and groceries,\" Vance wrote. \"She owns all of these failures, and she lied for nearly four years about Biden's mental capacity--saddling the nation with a president who can't do the job. President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket. Bring it on.\"\\n\\n## Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana\\n\\nHouse Speaker Johnson said Mr. Biden's announcement posed \"an unprecedented juncture in American history\" and claimed the president's decision invalidated the votes of millions of Americans who selected Biden as the Democratic nominee. \\n\\n\"The party's prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden Administration,\" Johnson said in a statement, calling on Mr. Biden to resign immediately. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,\" Johnson wrote, adding, \"November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky\\n\\n\"For four years, the American people have faced historic inflation at home, chaos at the border, and weak leadership on the world stage,\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. \"Our nation is less prosperous and less secure than it was in January, 2021. We cannot afford four more years of failure.\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country,\" McConnell added. \"Washington Democrats have not proven themselves any more capable than the President of delivering the secure borders, safe streets, and stable prices that working families deserve.\"\\n\\n## Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana\\n\\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise claimed that Democratic party leaders had \"absolutely no respect for their own voters.\"\\n\\n\"After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters,\" Scalise said in a statement.\\n\\n\"For years, Democrats and their partners in the media maligned Americans who questioned the President's fitness based on what they saw with their own eyes as conspiracy theorists,\" Scalise wrote. \"Every single one of these people - especially Vice President Harris - who participated in this cover up must answer for their involvement.\"\\n\\n   \n",

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n   \n",

Tate Reeves\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen a politician so strong and talented he made his opponent quit in the middle of the race? I have: Donald J. Trump,\" Gov. Reeves quipped on social media. \\n\\n## Trump presidential campaign\\n\\nIn a strongly worded statement earlier Sunday, senior Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles called Mr. Biden \"weak, pathetic, and incompetent.\"\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris is just as much of joke as Biden is,\" the advisers wrote. \"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden. Harris has been the Enabler in Chief for Crooked Joe this entire time. They own each other's records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\\n\\n\"Biden is a national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman, and child in our country,\" they added. \"The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?\"\\n\\n## Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden,\" Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote to CBS News. \"The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.\"\\n\\n### Election 2024\\n\\n【11†More】\\n\\n【12†Watch a full replay of the Vance-Walz VP debate】\\n\\n【13†Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown】\\n\\n【14†Who won the VP debate?

Rick Scott of Florida\\n\\n\"Let me be clear, if Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is not capable of serving as president for the next six months and needs to resign today,\" Sen. Scott said in a statement.\\n\\n\"It was painfully clear that Biden wasn't competent for office going way back to 2021,\" Scott wrote. \"Democrats laughed when I said Biden should be removed from office after his deadly Afghanistan withdrawal disaster. They're not laughing now. Over those four years, we have seen immense damage done to our country. Our border is wide-open, inflation is crushing American families, and countless Americans have lost their lives at home and abroad due to the policy decisions of Joe Biden and his 'border czar' Kamala Harris.\"\\n\\n\"While we welcome the news that one of America's most destructive presidents will be denied a second term, it changes very little as to the stakes of this election,\" he added. \"We cannot allow the American dream to be destroyed and replaced with California socialism. Come November, we will defeat the Democrats, elect Donald J. Trump, take back the Senate and the House, and save our country.\"\\n\\n## Republican National Committee leaders\\n\\n\"President Trump will win this election because he is the only person who will rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and secure our standing in the world,\" RNC Chairman Michael Whatley and Co-Chairman Lara Trump said in a statement following Mr. Biden's announcement.\\n\\n\"Every single failure we've seen from Joe Biden – the Afghanistan withdrawal, a border crisis, crushing inflation, and America weakened abroad – has been delivered hand-in-hand with Kamala Harris,\" they said. \"Not only would Harris be a disaster in the White House, but she also helped Biden cover up his declining health while in office, which destroys her credibility.\"\\n\\n\"As Democrats fall apart, President Trump is uniting the American people behind his winning agenda,\" they added.\\n\\n## NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson\\n\\nRichard Hudson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman, said in a statement, \"This is a scandal of historic proportions – our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust.\"\\n\\n\"Judgment day is coming in November, when Americans will hand down Democrats' ultimate punishment: Donald Trump in the White House and a larger House Republican majority,\" Hudson wrote, adding, \"If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?\"\\n\\n   \n",

Dev\\n\\nUpdated on: July 21, 2024 / 10:37 PM EDT / CBS News\\n\\n【1†How Trump campaign is shifting its strategy with Biden out of race 08:45】\\n\\nPresident Biden's 【2†unprecedented announcement on Sunday】 that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race prompted reactions from both sides of the aisle. \\n\\nHere's how former President Donald Trump — the 【3†2024 GOP nominee】 — as well as Republican senators, members of Congress, governors and high-profile party members are reacting to the president's decision to leave the race just weeks before the Democratic Convention, handing his endorsement to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n## Former President Donald Trump\\n\\nTrump said in a phone conversation Sunday with CBS News' Robert Costa that Mr. Biden's announcement came as \"a shock to the country.\"\\n\\nTrump said he believed Mr. Biden was pressured out of the race and \"shouldn't have been our president.\"\\n\\nHe also said that he wasn't sure if 【4†Vice President Kamala Harris】 would be the Democrats' nominee, but that while he waits to see how the race emerges, it wouldn't affect the way he proceeds with his campaign. Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\\n\\nAt the start of his statement, Trump also called Biden \"the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation.\"\\n\\nThe former president's campaign immediately began a new fundraising push following Biden's announcement, writing, \"But RIGHT NOW, he just quit the race in COMPLETE DISGRACE!\"\\n\\n【2†MORE: Read Joe Biden's full letter announcing he's leaving 2024 race】\\n\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson 【3†wrote on X†twitter.com】, \"At this unprecedented juncture in American history, we must be clear about what just happened.

We cannot afford four more years of failure.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has been busy in recent weeks trying to upend the expressed will of the American people in primary elections across the country. Washington Democrats have not proven themselves any more capable than the President of delivering the secure borders, safe streets, and stable prices that working families deserve. They are selling open borders, higher prices, climate radicalism, and soft-on-crime policies, and the American people are not buying,\" McConnell's statement concluded.\\n\\nTrump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, on behalf of the former president's campaign, issued a statement slamming Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\\n\\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is a complete fraud and a disgrace to our Country,\" they said in their statement. …\\n\\nThey continued, \"And during this entire term, Kamala Harris – as well as every other Democrat in Washington, sat by and did NOTHING.

Biden’s decision is also likely to raise questions about his ability to fulfill the duties of the presidency for the remainder of his term.\\n\\nIt’s the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s announcement. \\n\\nIt’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.\\n\\nBut not even the attempted assassination and its tumultuous effect on the race could pause the loss of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.\\n\\n## Exclusive: Trump responds to Biden dropping out\\n\\nFrom CNN's Kaitlan Collins\\n\\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Donald Trump described Biden going “down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.” \\n\\nWhile it’s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be, Trump said he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. \\n\\n## NRCC chairman describes Biden's decision as a \"scandal of historic proportions\"\\n\\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju\\n\\nThe head of the House GOP’s campaign arm, Richard Hudson, called President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential campaign a “scandal of historic proportions.”\\n\\n“Our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust,” he said.\\n\\nHudson questioned the ability of Biden to continue the remainder of his presidential campaign.\\n\\n“If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes.

Steve Ricchetti, another longtime adviser going back to his time as vice president, was charged with organizing the mechanics of the announcement. Both are in Rehoboth with Biden. \\n\\nBiden’s closest advisers and family were told of his decision on Saturday night as he put in motion the process of drafting the letter and the mechanics of its release. \\n\\nHe has spoken to all of his family since making the decision to drop out of the race, and his daughter Ashley and son-in-law Howard drove to Rehoboth earlier today, according to the source.\\n\\nIt is unclear if other family will join the Bidens in Delaware as the president continues to recover from Covid-19.\\n\\n## Biden campaign co-chair supports Harris\\n\\nFrom CNN's Maureen Chowdhury\\n\\nDelaware Sen. Chris Coons, long-time ally of Joe Biden and his campaign co-chair, said he supports Vice President Kamala Harris for replacing the president on the Democratic ticket.\\n\\nCoons described Harris as a “genuine leader” and said that he is “glad that President Biden has endorsed her today and made it clear the direction that he intends to take as the most respected senior leader in our party this fall. He was determined to beat Donald Trump and to make sure that the hard work he and Kamala Harris have done, leading our country this last four years, continues.”\\n\\nAs for Biden’s decision to step down, Coons noted that, “This is a historic moment, where our president is choosing to step aside in the best interest of the nation. And that is in the best tradition of Joe Biden’s life of putting our nation before himself.”\\n\\n## Harris says she will \"earn and win\" Democratic nomination\\n\\nFrom CNN's Betsy Klein\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris said in a statement she was “honored” to receive President Joe Biden’s endorsement and intends to “earn and win” the Democratic nomination for president in her first public statement since Biden’s stunning announcement.\\n\\n“I am honored to have the President’s endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination,” she said. \\n\\nThis statement was issued from the Biden-Harris campaign side, not the White House.\\n\\nShe vowed to “do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.” \\n\\nHarris offered her thanks and praise to Biden for his service, heralding his legacy and the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n\\n“With this selfless and patriotic act, President Biden is doing what he has done throughout his life of service: putting the American people and our country above everything else,” Harris said. \\n\\nThere are 107 days until Election Day, she noted, an acknowledgment of the very short period of time for Harris to consolidate her party’s support. \\n\\n“Together, we will fight. And together, we will win,” she said.\\n\\nThis post has been updated with more from Harris’ statement.\\n\\n   \n",

How did we get here? \\n\\nFrom CNN's Antoinette Radford\\n\\nThe calls for President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 race grew louder and louder over the past month, triggered by a shaky performance at the CNN presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee.\\n\\nDuring that debate, Biden often 【140†defaulted to an open-mouthed】, staring look while Trump was speaking. The president occasionally struggled to finish his thoughts or land punches, ceding ground on issues such as abortion where Democrats have an edge.\\n\\nIt had a significant impact on public confidence in the president, with his approval rating hitting a new low following the debate, according to a 【159†CNN poll conducted by SSRS†s3.documentcloud.org】. \\n\\nThat same poll found that three-quarters of US voters said the Democratic Party would have a better shot at holding the presidency in 2024 with someone other than 【12†Biden】 at the top of the ticket.\\n\\nAfter the dismal debate performance, the president had a new challenge showing both international leaders and voters at home that he was up to the top job as leaders gathered in Washington for the NATO conference. In a crucial speech, Biden’s first solo press conference 【160†since November 2023】, the president referred to 【161†Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky】 as Vladimir Putin — the name of the Russian president.\\n\\nAgain, public confidence in Biden plummeted.

Here's what you should know about the historic events today\\n\\nFrom CNN staff\\n\\nIn an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Read【13†more here】 about how the president came to his decision.\\n\\nHere are the key things to know:\\n\\n  * Biden wrote in a letter 【70†posted†twitter.com】 to his official account on X: “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\\n  * Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail. A senior White House official said his decision to withdrawl did not have to do with any medical issues.\\n  * In 【71†a follow-up post,†x.com】 Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her.\\n  * Biden has spent Sunday talking to 【72†members of Congress】, governors and supporters. The plans for Biden to 【61†exit the 2024】 race were set into motion last night and 【73†finalized today】, a source familiar with the matter said.\\n  * The president is still recovering from 【74†a Covid-19 diagnosis】 and has remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend.\\n\\nHow we got here: Age had been Biden’s biggest political weakness ever since he launched his first campaign against former President Donald Trump five years ago. After his faltering performance at CNN’s debate on June 27, a growing number of Democrats called on the president to step aside in the 2024 race even as Biden held a slew of events aiming to prove his fitness for office. 【31†Check out the full timeline】.\\n\\nWhat happens next: The Democratic Party will need to 【75†choose a new nominee】. That decision will ultimately be made by the roughly 4,700 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Either during a 【62†virtual roll call】, which is tentatively planned for early August, or at the convention in Chicago beginning August 19, these delegates will select any eligible candidate to be the party’s nominee. Learn about what could happen next 【58†here】.\\n\\nWhat about campaign money: According to the Campaign Legal Center, the campaign war chest — totaling 【76†$95.9 million at the end of June】 — would be directly available to the Democrats’ presidential ticket for use in the general election only if Harris is the party’s nominee or vice presidential nominee. If Harris does not end up on Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the existing campaign account could be converted into a political action committee and use its funds indirectly.\\n\\nKamala Harris in the spotlight\\n\\n  * Harris said she was 【77†“honored”】 to receive Biden’s endorsement and intended to “earn and win” the nomination. She vowed to “do everything in my power to 【15†unite the Democratic Party”】 and thanked Biden for the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n  * Various 【78†lawmakers】 have already【79† endorsed her】. The Biden campaign leadership also 【65†voiced support】 for Harris on an all-staff call. Donors have also indicated they are 【80†prepared to back Harris】.\\n  * Trump’s allies are 【81†launching attack ads】 targeting Harris, previewing sharp criticism and targeting key battleground states.\\n  * Another possible contender: Sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia independent, said he’s considering re-registering as a Democrat and 【18†throwing his hat into the ring】 to run for president.\\n\\nKey reactions\\n\\n  * First lady Dr. Jill Biden 【82†offered her support】 for whatever decision he chose, according to her communications director. Biden’s son Hunter praised his father’s 【83†lifetime of public service】.\\n  * Former President 【84†Barack Obama】 expressed his support for Biden, describing him as “a patriot of the highest order.”\\n  * Various Democratic 【85†lawmakers】, 【86†governors, mayors】 and 【87†international leaders】 have also released messages thanking and praising Biden’s time in office.\\n\\n   \n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【4†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【5†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【6†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Trump said he was running against the Biden administration's record regardless of who ended up on the ticket. \\n\\n\"I think she is no better than him. She could be far less competent, which is hard to believe,\" Trump said to Costa. \"The polls seem to think I'd do better against her than I do against him.\" \\n\\nHe also announced on social media that he was pulling out of plans for a presidential debate on ABC on Sept. 10, which he had 【5†previously agreed to】. \\n\\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,\" he wrote.\\n\\nEarlier, in a 【6†post†urldefense.com】 to his social media platform, Trump lambasted President Biden. \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!\" he wrote. \"He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement.\"\\n\\nIn another statement on his social media platform, Trump wrote, \"Crooked Joe Biden is the Worst President, by far, in the History of our Nation. He has done everything possible to destroy our Country, from our Southern Border, to Energy Dominance, National Security, International Standing, and so much more.\"\\n\\n\"He was annihilated in an Earth Shattering Debate, and now the Corrupt and Radical Democrats are throwing him overboard,\" Trump added.\\n\\nIn yet another social media post, Trump claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden never really 【7†had COVID】.\\n\\n\"Does anybody really believe that Crooked Joe had Covid? No, he wanted to get out ever since June 27th, the night of The Debate, where he was completely obliterated. That was the big moment in Joe Biden's demise,\" Trump wrote.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Youngkin wrote on social media late Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nHe called on the nation to come together \"to secure our borders, structure safe communities, grow an economy that lifts up all Americans and restores peace through strength.\"\\n\\n## Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen a politician so strong and talented he made his opponent quit in the middle of the race? I have: Donald J. Trump,\" Gov. Reeves quipped on social media. \\n\\n## Trump presidential campaign\\n\\nIn a strongly worded statement earlier Sunday, senior Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles called Mr. Biden \"weak, pathetic, and incompetent.\"\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris is just as much of joke as Biden is,\" the advisers wrote. \"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden. Harris has been the Enabler in Chief for Crooked Joe this entire time. They own each other's records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\\n\\n\"Biden is a national security threat in great cognitive decline and a clear and present danger to every man, woman, and child in our country,\" they added. \"The question then to Kamala Harris is simple: knowing that Joe Biden withdrew from the campaign because of his rapidly deteriorating condition, does Harris believe the people of America are safe and secure with Joe Biden in the White House for six more months?\"\\n\\n## Donald Trump Jr.\\n\\n\"Kamala Harris owns the entire leftwing policy record of Joe Biden,\" Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., wrote to CBS News. \"The only difference is that she is even more liberal and less competent than Joe, which is really saying something.\"\\n\\n### Election 2024\\n\\n【11†More】\\n\\n【12†Watch a full replay of the Vance-Walz VP debate】\\n\\n【13†Read the full VP debate transcript from the Walz-Vance showdown】\\n\\n【14†Who won the VP debate?

DeSantis wrote on social media, blaming Harris for what he called \"the worst border crisis in American history.\"\\n\\n\"Democrats are just rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" DeSantis wrote.\\n\\n## Rep.

Stefanik, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, also claimed that Mr. Biden's announcement shows he isn't fit to currently serve as president. \\n\\n\"If Joe Biden can't run for re-election, he is unable and unfit to serve as President of the United States,\" Stefanik said in a statement, urging Mr. Biden to \"immediately resign.\"\\n\\n\"Every elected Democrat in America owns Joe Biden's failed and feckless record causing the border crisis, Bidenflation, and chaos and weakness around the world,\" she wrote. \"President Trump will win this November to save America.\"\\n\\nLater Sunday, Stefanik wrote on social media that she planned to introduce a resolution Monday that condemned Harris' role in what she called \"the most catastrophic open border crisis in history.\"\\n\\n## Sen.

I opposed many of his initiatives.

However, having worked with him these past few years, I respect President Biden. His decision to withdraw from the race was right and is in the best interest of the country.\"\\n\\n## Sen. Steve Daines of Montana\\n\\nSen. Daines formally called on Mr. Biden to resign, saying the president \"is no longer capable of serving as President.\"\\n\\n\"Being President is the hardest job in the world, and I no longer have confidence that Joe Biden can effectively execute his duties as Commander-in-Chief,\" Daines said in a statement. \"It is out of concern for our country's national security that I am formally calling on President Biden to resign from office.\"\\n\\n\"It has also been striking that none of the Senate Democrats who served with Vice President Harris have called for her to replace President Biden,\" Daines added, saying he had doubts about Harris's ability to serve as president. \\n\\n</td>\n",

Biden’s decision is also likely to raise questions about his ability to fulfill the duties of the presidency for the remainder of his term.\\n\\nIt’s the first time a US president has dropped out of a reelection run in decades, recalling memories of President Lyndon Johnson deciding against seeking a second full term in 1968 – though Biden’s decision comes months later in the campaign than Johnson’s announcement. \\n\\nIt’s also the latest shocking development in a highly charged political campaign that has included an attempt on Trump’s life.\\n\\nBut not even the attempted assassination and its tumultuous effect on the race could pause the loss of support Biden was facing among congressional Democrats who became increasingly convinced that a wipeout in November would also drown their down-ballot contests as well.\\n\\n## Exclusive: Trump responds to Biden dropping out\\n\\nFrom CNN's Kaitlan Collins\\n\\nIn a phone call with CNN minutes after President Joe Biden announced his exit from the 2024 race, former President Donald Trump described Biden going “down as the single worst president by far in the history of our country.” \\n\\nWhile it’s unclear who the Democratic nominee will be, Trump said he thinks Vice President Kamala Harris will be easier to defeat than Biden would have been. \\n\\n## NRCC chairman describes Biden's decision as a \"scandal of historic proportions\"\\n\\nFrom CNN's Manu Raju\\n\\nThe head of the House GOP’s campaign arm, Richard Hudson, called President Joe Biden’s decision to drop out of the presidential campaign a “scandal of historic proportions.”\\n\\n“Our president is incapacitated, Democrats knew, and they lied to the American people to cover it up. Voters will neither forgive nor forget the ultimate betrayal of their trust,” he said.\\n\\nHudson questioned the ability of Biden to continue the remainder of his presidential campaign.\\n\\n“If the president is mentally unfit to campaign, he is mentally unfit to have the nuclear codes. Every House Democrat must now answer: is the president fit to serve the rest of his term?”\\n\\n## Biden announces he will not seek reelection\\n\\nFrom CNN's Sam Fossum\\n\\nPresident Joe Biden 【61†announced he will not seek reelection】 amid continued pressure following a disastrous debate performance last month that left many in his party questioning whether he should continue to seek reelection. He will serve out the remainder of his term.\\n\\n“And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,” Biden wrote in a letter he posted on his 【184†X account.†x.com】\\n\\nHe added: “I will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.”\\n\\n“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,” he wrote.\\n\\nThis post has been updated with additional updates on Biden’s announcement.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>## Biden has stepped down as presidential candidate just months out from the election. How did we get here? \\n\\nFrom CNN's Antoinette Radford\\n\\nThe calls for President Joe Biden to step aside from the 2024 race grew louder and louder over the past month, triggered by a shaky performance at the CNN presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee.\\n\\nDuring that debate, Biden often 【140†defaulted to an open-mouthed】, staring look while Trump was speaking. The president occasionally struggled to finish his thoughts or land punches, ceding ground on issues such as abortion where Democrats have an edge.\\n\\nIt had a significant impact on public confidence in the president, with his approval rating hitting a new low following the debate, according to a 【159†CNN poll conducted by SSRS†s3.documentcloud.org】. \\n\\nThat same poll found that three-quarters of US voters said the Democratic Party would have a better shot at holding the presidency in 2024 with someone other than 【12†Biden】 at the top of the ticket.\\n\\nAfter the dismal debate performance, the president had a new challenge showing both international leaders and voters at home that he was up to the top job as leaders gathered in Washington for the NATO conference. In a crucial speech, Biden’s first solo press conference 【160†since November 2023】, the president referred to 【161†Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky】 as Vladimir Putin — the name of the Russian president.\\n\\nAgain, public confidence in Biden plummeted. And the news only got worse for the 81-year-old president when he 【74†tested positive to Covid-19】 on Wednesday.\\n\\nAmid concerns about his physical and mental capabilities in the role, Biden remained steadfast: He would not exit the race.\\n\\nBy Thursday, even the 【30†most senior-ranking White House officials】 privately believed Biden needed to abandon his campaign for a second term, and to do it soon.\\n\\nSenior Democrat Nancy Pelosi weighed in on the matter, 【162†privately telling Biden】 that polling showed he could not defeat Trump and could destroy Democrats’ chances of winning the House in November.\\n\\nAnd on Sunday morning, hours before Biden announced his decision to step down, 【96†independent Sen. Joe Manchin】 echoed other lawmakers in encouraging Biden to “pass the torch” to a new generation of leadership.\\n\\nCNN’s Betsy Klein, Kasie Hunt, MJ Lee, Lauren Fox and Kayla Tausche contributed to this post.\\n\\n</td>\n",

              "      <td>## Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race. Here's what you should know about the historic events today\\n\\nFrom CNN staff\\n\\nIn an unprecedented move, President Joe Biden announced on Sunday that is exiting the 2024 presidential race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Read【13†more here】 about how the president came to his decision.\\n\\nHere are the key things to know:\\n\\n  * Biden wrote in a letter 【70†posted†twitter.com】 to his official account on X: “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”\\n  * Biden said he will speak to the nation later this week in more detail. A senior White House official said his decision to withdrawl did not have to do with any medical issues.\\n  * In 【71†a follow-up post,†x.com】 Biden praised Harris and urged Democrats to unite behind her.\\n  * Biden has spent Sunday talking to 【72†members of Congress】, governors and supporters. The plans for Biden to 【61†exit the 2024】 race were set into motion last night and 【73†finalized today】, a source familiar with the matter said.\\n  * The president is still recovering from 【74†a Covid-19 diagnosis】 and has remained at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, all weekend.\\n\\nHow we got here: Age had been Biden’s biggest political weakness ever since he launched his first campaign against former President Donald Trump five years ago. After his faltering performance at CNN’s debate on June 27, a growing number of Democrats called on the president to step aside in the 2024 race even as Biden held a slew of events aiming to prove his fitness for office. 【31†Check out the full timeline】.\\n\\nWhat happens next: The Democratic Party will need to 【75†choose a new nominee】. That decision will ultimately be made by the roughly 4,700 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Either during a 【62†virtual roll call】, which is tentatively planned for early August, or at the convention in Chicago beginning August 19, these delegates will select any eligible candidate to be the party’s nominee. Learn about what could happen next 【58†here】.\\n\\nWhat about campaign money: According to the Campaign Legal Center, the campaign war chest — totaling 【76†$95.9 million at the end of June】 — would be directly available to the Democrats’ presidential ticket for use in the general election only if Harris is the party’s nominee or vice presidential nominee. If Harris does not end up on Democrats’ 2024 ticket, the existing campaign account could be converted into a political action committee and use its funds indirectly.\\n\\nKamala Harris in the spotlight\\n\\n  * Harris said she was 【77†“honored”】 to receive Biden’s endorsement and intended to “earn and win” the nomination. She vowed to “do everything in my power to 【15†unite the Democratic Party”】 and thanked Biden for the “honor” of serving alongside him. \\n  * Various 【78†lawmakers】 have already【79† endorsed her】. The Biden campaign leadership also 【65†voiced support】 for Harris on an all-staff call. Donors have also indicated they are 【80†prepared to back Harris】.\\n  * Trump’s allies are 【81†launching attack ads】 targeting Harris, previewing sharp criticism and targeting key battleground states.\\n  * Another possible contender: Sources close to Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia independent, said he’s considering re-registering as a Democrat and 【18†throwing his hat into the ring】 to run for president.\\n\\nKey reactions\\n\\n  * First lady Dr. Jill Biden 【82†offered her support】 for whatever decision he chose, according to her communications director. Biden’s son Hunter praised his father’s 【83†lifetime of public service】.\\n  * Former President 【84†Barack Obama】 expressed his support for Biden, describing him as “a patriot of the highest order.”\\n  * Various Democratic 【85†lawmakers】, 【86†governors, mayors】 and 【87†international leaders】 have also released messages thanking and praising Biden’s time in office.\\n\\n</td>\n",

Instead, they vote for 538 officials, who are allocated to American states based on their population size.\\n\\nExplaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins\\n\\nThe electors almost always vote for the candidate who won the most votes in their states, and although it is possible for some to disregard the voters' pick, no result has ever been changed this way.\\n\\nMr Trump also said that he was planning to hold a rally in Georgia on Saturday in support of two Republicans in key runoff elections that will decide which party controls the Senate. The elections in Georgia are due to be held on 5 January.\\n\\n## What's the latest from Biden?\\n\\nThe president-elect celebrated a quiet Thanksgiving on Thursday, as coronavirus cases in the US continue to rise.\\n\\n\"This year, our turkey will be smaller and the clatter of cooking a little quieter,\" 【11†Mr Biden and his wife Jill said in an op-ed published by CNN†edition.cnn.com】. \"Like millions of Americans, we are temporarily letting go of the traditions we can't do safely.\\n\\n\"It is not a small sacrifice. These moments with our loved ones - time that's lost - can't be returned. Yet, we know it's the price of protecting each other and one we don't pay alone.\"\\n\\n\"We're at war with a virus, not with one another\": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19\\n\\nEarlier this week, Mr Biden urged Americans to hold smaller celebrations, saying: \"I know that we can and will beat this virus.\" He has said that tackling the pandemic will be his main priority when he takes office.\\n\\n【12†Mr Biden has already nominated a number of top officials†www.bbc.co.uk】 for when he takes over and said that co-operation from the White House over the transition had been \"sincere\".\\n\\nSpeaking in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Wednesday, he said that the US \"won't stand\" for any attempt to derail the election. Americans \"have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,\" he said.\\n\\n【13†Trump accepts transition to Biden must begin】\\n\\n【14†Why does US presidential transition matter?】\\n\\n【15†What Biden's new team tells us】\\n\\n【16†Legal battles looming for Trump】\\n\\n【17†'To my Republican friends'】\\n\\n【18†Five reasons Biden won】\\n\\n【19†Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last】\\n\\n* * *</td>\n",
